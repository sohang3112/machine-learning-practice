# Machine Learning & Deep Learning
## Notes & Practice Exercises
Practice Notes on Machine Learning (with code &amp; data for practice exercises). Prefer the most popular libraries - `sklearn` for ML, `pytorch` for Deep Learning.

### Books
- [Flexible Imputation of Missing Data](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd)

### TODO
- [-] Try Classification with [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris): available in `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`. **WIP:** Did Principal Component Analysis to reduce feature dimensions.
- [ ] Explore ML methods with [tabular datasets](https://dagshub.com/datasets/tabular/).
- [ ] Try making adverserial inputs for famous CNNs like VGG.
